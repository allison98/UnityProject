# Unity Game Development

My personal project this year is to create a small computer game using Unity. Having gone through the **Junior Programmer** tutorials offered by Unity, I've learned the basics of C# programming in Unity to start creating my own game.

The idea so far is a game where the main character is to collect *flowers*. I want the look and feel of the game to be bright and happy with simple game play for now. After developing the basic gameplay, I hope to try and create my own assets!

## To Do
- [x] camera control
- [x] player control
- [x] flower and rabbit spawning
- [x] flower death by rabbit
- [ ] update player physics and interactions with other objects
    - [ ] what happens to flowers when player passes through
    - [ ] player picking up flowers
- [ ] animation for flower growing and dying
- [ ] user gui for collection of flowers
- [ ] refactoring
- [ ] graphics
- [ ] surrounding environment
- [ ] gameplay
    - [ ] player defense, attack, etc
