# Unity Game Development

My personal project this year is to create a small computer game using Unity. Having gone through the **Junior Programmer** tutorials offered by Unity, I've learned the basics of C# programming in Unity to start creating my own game.

The idea so far is a game where the main character is to collect *flowers*. I want the look and feel of the game to be bright and happy with simple game play for now. After developing the basic gameplay, I hope to try and create my own assets!
