# Unity Game Development

My personal project this year is to create a small computer game using Unity. Having gone through the **Junior Programmer** tutorials offered by Unity, I've learned the basics of C# programming in Unity to start creating my own game.

The idea so far is a game where the main character is to collect *flowers*. I want the look and feel of the game to be bright and happy with simple game play for now. After developing the basic gameplay, I hope to try and create my own assets!

## To Do
- [x] camera control
- [x] player control
- [x] flower and rabbit spawning
- [x] flower death by rabbit
- [] update player physics and interactions with other objects
    - [] what happens to flowers when player passes through
    - [] player picking up flowers
- [] animation for flower growing and dying
- [] user gui for collection of flowers
- [] refactoring
